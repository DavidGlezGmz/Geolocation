# Geolocation

Geocoding is the process of transforming a description of a location (such as a physical address, or a name of a place) into a pair of latitude and longitude on the Earth's surface for that place.

It also refers to converting geographic coordinates to a description of a location (such as an address), this is often called reverse geocoding. In this tutorial, we will learn how to do both with the help of GeoPy library in Python.

GeoPy is a Python client that provides several popular geocoding web services, it makes it easy for Python developers to locate the coordinates of an address, a city, or a country and vice-versa.
